# Cosmos bridge

Similar to Polkadot, Cosmos is a decentralized ecosystem of independent parallel blockchains that can scale and interoperate with each other via a common messaging standard. This network of networks has seen enormous growth and some of the most popular fiat-pegged tokens in the cryptocurrency sphere.

Pendulumâ€™s Cosmos bridge will be based on the [Substrate-IBC pallet](https://github.com/octopus-network/substrate-ibc) developed by [Astar](https://astar.network).
