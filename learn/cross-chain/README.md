# Cross-chain

## Fiat tokens availability

One of the core pillars of Pendulum is its capacity to collect and connect fiat-pegged tokens from the most prominent blockchain ecosystems into a single, optimized blockchain system. By giving project developers and token holders access to a broad basket of fiat tokens, Pendulum unlocks an evolution in money markets and borderless financial transactions.&#x20;

Connecting across different ecosystems requires different solutions depending on the nature of the target network: in some cases it will be network-specific bridges, in other integrations into multichain bridges or the DotSama relay chain through the cross-chain messaging protocol. In order to ensure that the bridged tokens are distributed as wide as possible within the DotSama ecosystem, a Statemine/Statemint integration is planned. One key design principle is to ensure that the bridge technologies are as trustless and robust as possible. In the below section, we will look at some of the planned bridge technologies and options.
