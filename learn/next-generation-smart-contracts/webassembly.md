# WebAssembly

Wasm, a Web-technology developed and maintained by a W3C workgroup that includes, among others, Google and Mozilla is heralded as the next base layer for decentralized applications. Using Wasm for smart contracts has lots of advantages like performance that is near native machine code, a small size, and efficient just-in-time execution. Smart contracts can be written in any of the many languages that can compile to Wasm, including C/C++, Rust, Go, and also Solidity, the most widely used programming language for smart contracts. Pendulum developers will be able to write smart contracts in the language of their choice and use existing tools and methods, which ultimately flattens the learning curve for the community and decreases implementation costs for dApp and project builders.

While Wasm has already seen broad adoption on the open Web, the integration into blockchain systems is still in its early stages. For the long awaited Ethereum 2.0, Wasm has been worked on as a candidate for an [EVM replacement](http://ewasm.readthedocs.io/en/mkdocs), but not yet fully finalized. Within the DotSama ecosystem, Pendulum is participating in the community effort to improve the performance and security of Wasm.
