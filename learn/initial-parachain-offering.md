# Initial Parachain Offering

To maximize connectivity and get the full security benefits of the Polkadot/Kusama networks, Pendulum must lease a [parachain slot](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-auction). The leases are delegated via an auction process, where DOT or KSM tokens are placed as bonds during the lease period. Mostly, these leases are secured via crowdloans, where the DotSama community of token holders can lock their DOT/KSM tokens with projects. As compensation for the opportunity cost of having their tokens locked in a bond for the lease period, the native parachain tokens are distributed to the stakers.&#x20;

First, Pendulum plans to secure a parachain lease on Kusama, the “wild cousin” network of Polkadot, where early versions of new technologies, incentive models, and governance structures can be tested with real skin in the game. After the core technology is established, Pendulum will bid for a lease on Polkadot and roll out the parachain there.
