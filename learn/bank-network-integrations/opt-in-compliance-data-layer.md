# Opt-in compliance data layer

In order to make the TradFi integrations as seamless as possible, Pendulum includes a voluntary and trustless data layer for the transmission of compliance data. The layer governs the secure, end-to-end encrypted passing of information between two entities on the network, for example, in the context of an offramp transaction. The standard is currently being defined alongside experienced compliance service providers with the goal of minimizing the number of compliance checks that a given customer must undertake in the process of interacting with multiple regulated services. For example, a customer may onramp with credit card in one country, but eventually offramp with a neobank in another â€” the customer can in this case volunteer to let the two services securely share the compliance data, thereby avoiding multiple compliance processes.
