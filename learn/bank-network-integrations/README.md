# Bank network integrations

Building integrations into the traditional financial networks broadens the scope of Pendulum, as both consumers and financial institutions are able to participate in the network activities. With an emphasis on both the fiat deposit and withdrawal processes and an optional data layer for the transmission and management of compliance processes, Pendulum allows dApps to build seamless consumer user experiences.
