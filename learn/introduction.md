# Introduction

Throughout the centuries, the tools of money have evolved to be evermore inclusive and accessible in an increasingly globalized and borderless world. From trading metal coins, to investing in stocks to sending online bank transactions. However, the centralized traditional financial systems, which historically provided these tools, tend to be unable to deliver flexible and composable services. Global fiat transfers and interactions in traditional finance suffer from high fees, slow speeds and primitive optionality. In contrast, the explosive growth in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) has brought about tools for building innovative financial products for future generations. But to date, bridging compliant fiat fintech services over to DeFi ecosystems has been a struggle. Enter Pendulum.&#x20;

Built on Polkadotâ€™s Substrate framework, Pendulum establishes the missing link between fiat and DeFi with a sophisticated smart contract network. Pendulum chain aims to become the one-stop hub for the internet of fiat. Innovations that Pendulum will bring include:&#x20;

1. Cross-chain trust-minimized bridges making a broad basket of fiat-pegged stable tokens available&#x20;
2. Next-generation smart contract technology.&#x20;
3. An institution-grade compliance layer with privacy features.
4. Seamless on/offramps for integrations into local banking networks.

This litepaper will present an outline of the technology and plans to bring Pendulum blockchain to market.
