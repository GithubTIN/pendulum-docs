# Roadmap

The inception of the Pendulum vision by SatoshiPay began in the summer of 2021. Since then development has begun and 2022 has seen significant support from the Stellar and Dotsama ecosystems. Pendulum is now live on Polkadot mainnet after winning a record-breaking crowdloan and Pendulum's sister network, Amplitude, also had a successful Kusama parachain auction.
