# Stellar

In June 2021 SatoshiPay received an [R\&D grant from Stellar Development Foundation](https://satoshipay.medium.com/satoshipay-receives-r-d-grant-from-stellar-for-pendulum-blockchain-eca0cbb7c397) to start the development of the Pendulum network. Pendulum can benefit Stellar by connecting Stellar to the wider DeFi ecosystem by adding smart contract support and bridging it to Ethereum and Polkadot.
