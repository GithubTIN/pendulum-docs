# Delegation

## How to delegate

In order to stake with a collator, you must first find a collator.

To look up a list of available collators:

1. Navigate to the tab `Developer` > `Chainstate`&#x20;
2. Query for: `parachainStaking` and select the `topCandidates()` function
   1. You can see all collators by selecting the `candidatePool()` option and toggling options **off**
3. You can now select an ID to delegate to

```bash
Do note that due to the current UI implementation on Polkadot.js staking X 
amount requires the addition of 12 0s 
Staking 10 â†’ 10 000 000 000 000
```

You can correctly delegate by filling the previous form with one or more of these `ids`

The transaction can now be submitted to perform the join delegators action
