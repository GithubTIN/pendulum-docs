# FAQ

**What is Amplitude?** \
Amplitude is a canary network of its sister blockchain, Pendulum. It will act as a testing ground for applications and network parameters for Pendulum. Unlike a traditional testnet, users can interact on the Amplitude chain with real financial consequences. We’re expecting lots of novel concepts to be trialled on Amplitude, giving rise to many exciting opportunities for anyone using the chain.

**What is a Crowdloan?** \
A crowdloan serves to trustlessly crowdsource KSM to bid on a parachain slot in Kusama’s parachain auctions. It is not exactly a loan, rather it is a way of locking your KSM tokens in order to vote for a parachain to successfully win a parachain slot in the network. For more information see our [quick overview](https://pendulum-chain.medium.com/parachain-auctions-and-crowdloans-on-polkadot-kusama-a-quick-overview-2e4892a0ec90).

**Will I get my KSM back?** \
Yes. Your KSM tokens will be automatically returned to you when the parachain lease ends after 48 weeks, when Amplitude wins the auction. Remember, we never have custody over your KSM. All KSM staked for Kusama crowdloans are secured by the Kusama Relay Chain.

**How do I know how much AMPE bonuses I will get?** You can check your rewards and their breakdown here on the [Amplitude Crowdloan Dashboard. ](https://pendulumchain.org/amplitude/rewards)****

**What is the breakdown of the AMPE bonuses?** \
****Base reward: 600 AMPE for every 1 KSM contributed.

Waitlist referral bonus: 10% additional AMPE, split equally between referrer and referral.

Amplifier Campaign: 3% bonus AMPE credited to the referral link after completion.

Early Bird Bonus: 20% early bird bonus in AMPE tokens for contributing within the first 10,000 KSM that was raised.

Early Bird Bonus: 10% early bird bonus in AMPE tokens for contributing between 10,001–20,000 KSM being raised.

**How to receive rewards?** \
Rewards will automatically be sent to your Amplitude address, which will be derived from the Kusama address you contributed with according to our release schedule. You may access them as soon as Talisman integrates Amplitude. If you want to access your AMPE earlier, you may import your private keys into a polkadot.js wallet.

**What happens now we have won the parachain auction?** \
Crowdloan contributors receive AMPE to their Amplitude address automatically according to the release schedule. Winning the parachain auction allows us to plug into Kusama as a parachain for 48 weeks and everyone is welcome to start using and building dApps on Amplitude. After the 48 week lease period expires, the KSM are automatically returned to the Kusama addresses of contributors, in addition to any rewards and bonuses accumulated.

**Can Amplitude access my KSM?** \
****Amplitude never has custody of your KSM tokens. Your KSM tokens stay bonded to the crowdloan module on the Kusama Relay Chain and you will be able to see them inside your wallet.

**What is the most user-friendly KSM wallet?** \
[Talisman ](https://talisman.xyz/)is one of the most user-friendly Kusama & parachain wallets. Managing your wallet and contributing to our crowdloan via Talisman is probably the easiest way to go about it.
