# Crowdloan

Parachain slot crowdloans are a way for new projects to get their parachain on Polkadot and Kusama. To become a parachain, a project must first bid through an auction for a parachain slot. Pendulum's sister network, [Amplitude](https://pendulumchain.org/amplitude), won the Kusama [auction 42](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/amplitude-wins-kusama-parachain-slot-80e07781ddbd) with more than 24,080 KSM (approximately $1,172,930) received. The Pendulum crowdloan on Polkadot is projected for Q4 this year.&#x20;
