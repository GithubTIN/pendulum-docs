# Crowdloan

Parachain slot crowdloans are a way for new projects to get their parachain on Polkadot and Kusama. To become a parachain, a project must first bid through an auction for a parachain slot. \

In December 2022, Pendulum was [DotSamaâ€™s fastest crowdloan success](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/pendulum-wins-polkadot-parachain-in-3-minutes-dfc206ed01ce) with the 300,000 DOT (approximately $1.4M) hardcap being reached in 3 minutes. \

In June 2022, Pendulum's sister network, [Amplitude](https://pendulumchain.org/amplitude), won the Kusama [auction 42](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/amplitude-wins-kusama-parachain-slot-80e07781ddbd) with more than 24,080 KSM (approximately $1,172,930) received. &#x20;
