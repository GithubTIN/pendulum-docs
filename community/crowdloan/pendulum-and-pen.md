# Pendulum & PEN

Pendulum won auction 35 and our Polkadot parachain went live on Mainnet 14th February 2023. &#x20;

A Polkadot crowdloan serves to trustlessly crowdsource DOT to bid on a parachain slot in Polkadot's parachain auctions. It is not exactly a loan, rather it is a way of locking your DOT tokens in order to vote for a parachain to successfully win a parachain slot in the network. For more information see our [quick overview](https://pendulum-chain.medium.com/parachain-auctions-and-crowdloans-on-polkadot-kusama-a-quick-overview-2e4892a0ec90).
