**The Crowdloan Process**

Our crowdloan allows Pendulum to raise the required DOT to secure a parachain slot on Polkadot and to distribute PEN tokens to the earliest supporters in the community. DOT contributed to a successful crowdloan and will be locked for the duration of the parachain lease for 96 weeks.

Contributors to our successful crowdloan will receive PEN tokens for 96 weeks according to our vesting schedule. The contributed DOT will be unlocked trustlessly and automatically after 96 weeks and returned to contributors.
