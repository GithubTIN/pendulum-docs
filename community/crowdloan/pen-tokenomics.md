**Community Distribution**\
****The chart below shows the percentage that each community bucket takes up from the community bucket that takes up 50% of the total PEN total allocation. The community distribution includes staking rewards for directly staking PEN (28%) as well as staking rewards related to Spacewalk bridge (12%). The Polkadot crowdloan [waitlist is now open](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/claim-your-pendulum-polkadot-crowdloan-waitlist-spot-now-e2df97ff06a9) where you can earn bonus rewards for signing up early.

_Note: The percentages in the Community and Backers charts should be halved to find the percentage of the overall tokenomics. For example, Staking Rewards is 14% of the overall tokenomics and 28% of the Community bucket._

**Vesting Schedule**\
****Below is the vesting schedule for all community and backer tokens. Most of the tokens include a vesting schedule that unlocks linearly over 2 to 3 years to ensure all participants are incentivized to work towards Pendulum’s long-term growth.
