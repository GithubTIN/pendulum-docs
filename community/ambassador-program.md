# Ambassador Program

The Pendulum & Amplitude ambassador program welcomes engaged community members to become an official part of our team. This offers the opportunity for you to be directly involved with the team, get invited to our events and help shape the course of both projects. We’re looking for a variety of people with a variety of skillsets including community management, marketing, translation, development and other areas.

If you are passionate about transforming fiat on DeFi with Amplitude & Pendulum, please get in touch. We’ll have a look at which areas you can add the most value and make sure you meet the right people to make it work. Benefits for ambassadors can include AMPE & PEN token rewards for your contributions, direct access to the team, merchandise and personalized event invitations.
