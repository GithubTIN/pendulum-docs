**What is Pendulum?**

Pendulum is an open-source blockchain that aims to establish the missing link between the fiat and the DeFi ecosystems through a fiat-optimized smart contract blockchain Pendulum is built with Substrate and will allow connecting DeFi applications to the foreign exchange market, building automated market makers (AMMs) to introduce scalable liquidity pools for fiat currencies, and create yield earning opportunities for fiat token holders.

Weâ€™re expecting lots of novel concepts to be trialled on Amplitude, giving rise to many exciting opportunities for anyone using the chain. Imagination is the only limitation.

The Spacewalk bridge will enable Pendulum chain to utilize the multitude of fiat stable tokens on the Stellar blockchain and help build the fiat DeFi future. Spacewalk is the first bridge between the Stellar network and the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystems, which opens up a flow of stable tokens from the Stellar network. Based on XCLAIM and interBTC, it is implemented as a Substrate pallet and allows any Substrate-based blockchain to implement a direct Stellar bridge.
