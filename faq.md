# FAQ

### Are there any Pendulum tokens available?

At the moment, there are no tokens available.

### Is "XYZ" your token?

Other tokens named “Pendulum” are not associated with us.

In June we posted a warning saying that projects named "Pendulum" publicly announcing a token are not affiliated with us. This includes the project mentioned.

We also recently added a disclaimer to our website.

### What is the difference between Stellar AMM and Pendulum?

The Stellar AMM is based on "CAP-0038" (CAP = "Core Advancement Proposal"). That means: it's not an open smart contract system, it's a fixed AMM algorithm based on simple Uniswap logic any upgrades will have to be negotiated with community (always slow process) and adopted by all Core Nodes (also slow) in short: not a innovative system where there can be many novel approaches ("let the best one win"), but just one single AMM largely proposed and maintained by a core group of developers (mostly, SDF)

### Can Pendulum bridge any Stellar asset with any Ethereum/Polkadot contract?

Yes, that’s our plan! All Stellar assets will be mirrored through Pendulum and we aim to connect them with every contract on Ethereum and Polkadot.
