# FAQ

### Are there any Pendulum tokens available?

At the moment, there are no tokens available.

### Is "XYZ" your token?

Other tokens named “Pendulum” are not associated with us.

In June we posted a [warning](https://twitter.com/pendulum\_chain/status/1406992561995190275) saying that projects named "Pendulum" publicly announcing a token are not affiliated with us. This includes the project mentioned.

We also recently added a disclaimer to our [website](https://pendulumchain.org).

### What is the difference between Stellar AMM and Pendulum?

The Stellar AMM is based on "CAP-0038" (CAP = "Core Advancement Proposal"). That means:&#x20;

* It's not an open smart contract system, it's a fixed AMM algorithm based on simple Uniswap logic&#x20;
* Any upgrades will have to be negotiated with community (always slow process) and adopted by all Core Nodes (also slow)&#x20;
* In short: not a innovative system where there can be many novel approaches ("let the best one win"), but just one single AMM largely proposed and maintained by a core group of developers (mostly, SDF)
