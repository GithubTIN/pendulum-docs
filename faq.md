# FAQ

**What is Pendulum?**

Pendulum is an open-source blockchain that aims to establish the missing link between the fiat and the DeFi ecosystems through a fiat-optimized smart contract blockchain Pendulum is built with Substrate and will allow connecting DeFi applications to the foreign exchange market, building automated market makers (AMMs) to introduce scalable liquidity pools for fiat currencies, and create yield earning opportunities for fiat token holders.

**What is Amplitude?**&#x20;

Amplitude is going to launch as a canary network of its sister blockchain, Pendulum. It will act as a testing ground for applications and network parameters for Pendulum. Unlike a traditional testnet, users can interact on the Amplitude chain with real financial consequences. We’re expecting lots of novel concepts to be trialed on Amplitude, giving rise to many exciting opportunities for anyone using the chain. Imagination is the only limitation.

**Who are SatoshiPay?**

[SatoshiPay ](https://satoshipay.io/)are the developers of Pendulum. They were founded in 2014 with the mission of connecting the world through instant payments. Learn more about [our journey here](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/why-launch-pendulum-on-polkadot-7663d576591d).&#x20;

**Are there any Pendulum & Amplitude tokens available?**&#x20;

No tokens have been released by Pendulum. Any existing tokens with the same or similar name have no affiliation with us.

**How can I purchase PEN & AMPE tokens?**&#x20;

Currently there is no option to purchase PEN or AMPE tokens. Participating in the our crowdloans is the best way of obtaining tokens. [Sign up to the Amplitude waitlist](https://pendulumchain.org/amplitude?utm\_source=medium\&utm\_medium=social\&utm\_campaign=waitlist\_announce\&utm\_term=08-06-2022) and contribute to the crowdloan to to access AMPE tokens.

**When is the TGE (Token Generation Event)?**&#x20;

We will generate tokens when rolling out the Pendulum and Amplitude mainnet respectively.

**What is the tokenomics for the PEN & AMPE tokens?**&#x20;

The tokenomics for the AMPE token will be published on our Medium page shortly. PEN tokenomics will be decided and published closer to the PEN token launch.&#x20;

**Where can I use the Testnet?**&#x20;

The Rococo Testnet is scheduled to launch in Q3 this year.

**When are Pendulum & Amplitude going to launch?**&#x20;

Amplitude Kusama Mainnet is projected to launch in Q3 this year. Pendulum Polkadot Mainnet is projected to launch in Q4 this year.

**When will Pendulum participate in a Polkadot parachain auction?**&#x20;

The Pendulum crowdloan is projected to start in Q4.

**When will Amplitude participate in a Kusama parachain auction?**&#x20;

The Amplitude crowdloan will start on June 29th.

**What kind of smart contracts will the Pendulum & Amplitude VM support?**&#x20;

Pendulum will support EVM as well as WASM smart contracts. Learn more about why Pendulum supports WASM [here](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/the-bright-future-of-webassembly-smart-contracts-fd7e74301aea).&#x20;

**Is there a possibility to use XLM for gas fees on Pendulum & Amplitude?**

TX fees will be settled in Pendulums and Amplitudes native token PEN & AMPE, however, we are exploring accepting other tokens to settle transaction fees as well.

**What is Spacewalk?**&#x20;

[Spacewalk ](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/introducing-spacewalk-the-trust-minimized-bridge-between-stellar-and-pendulum-68ddbe7349a0)is a framework for trust-minimized and decentralized bridges. It enables Polkadot parachains to connect to various blockchains in a unified manner. Spacewalk solves multiple challenges that bridge builders encounter, such as connecting to chains that don’t support smart contracts or SPV. As an example we present a bridge to Stellar that supports multiple assets and stable coins and share our concept for bridging to other ecosystems like Celo or Solana.

**What is a Polkadot parachain and how does this relate to Pendulum?**&#x20;

Polkadot is a layer zero network of connected blockchains that we call parachains. Polkadot offers parachains security and interoperability between each other and the many different blockchains in the cryptoverse. Polkadot hosts [crowdloans and auctions](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/parachain-auctions-and-crowdloans-on-polkadot-kusama-a-quick-overview-2e4892a0ec90) for new parachains to join the network.&#x20;

**How to setup a Polkadot wallet?**&#x20;

Here is a [5 step guide](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/how-to-setup-a-polkadot-wallet-a-5-step-guide-7f87536837d5) on how to set up a [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/) wallet. Alternative wallets include [imtoken](https://token.im/), [trustwallet](https://trustwallet.com/), [tokenpocket](https://www.tokenpocket.pro/en), [coolwallet](https://www.coolwallet.io/coolwallet\_pro/), [safepal](https://safepal.io/), [Ledger Nano X](https://www.ledger.com/), [atomic wallet](https://atomicwallet.io/) and more.

**What is Pendulum's relationship with Stellar?**&#x20;

Stellar has a multitude of fiat-pegged stablecoins on its network which will be able to interact with DeFi via Pendulum. Stellar issued SatoshiPay a [R\&D grant to develop Pendulum](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/pendulum-receives-a-research-and-development-grant-from-stellar-development-foundation-9756a50a1d5a) in June 2021.&#x20;
