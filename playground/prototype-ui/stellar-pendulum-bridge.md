# Stellar-Pendulum Bridge

The **bridge** allows for the movement of assets from Stellar to Pendulum and vice versa.

In the Playground, the trusted assets by default are USDC or EUR, but our testnet supports any generic asset that the user trusts and would want to move between networks.

If you go to the Bridge page by clicking the “BRIDGE” button, you can see a balance of 100 USDC and 100 EUR for your account on the Stellar Network.

The table displays the account balances on both networks for USDC and EUR assets.

You can use the bridge view to make a deposit to Pendulum or make a withdrawal to Stellar.

Let us make a deposit of 18 EUR tokens to Pendulum. For this, we just need to select the EUR asset and type ‘18’ in the amount field and press the “TO PENDULUM” button, which will be grayed out while processing the transaction.

After the transaction succeeds, we can see the balance updated on the table, showing the 18 EUR we received. Now, we can repeat the same process for USDC.

Now let’s go the other way around by withdrawing 7 EUR from Pendulum. The process is the same as for the deposit, except that you need to press the “TO STELLAR” button, pretty straightforward, right?

After some seconds – if everything goes well – you will be able to see your balance updated on the Stellar side.
