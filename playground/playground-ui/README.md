# Playground UI

To make it easy for smart contract developers to upload and test their smart contracts, we provide a modified version of [Canvas UI](https://github.com/paritytech/canvas-ui). You can access the Pendulum playground at [playground.pendulumchain.org](https://playground.pendulumchain.org).

This guide will walk you through the steps required to deploy a WASM smart contract on Pendulum using the provided Playground UI. For illustration purposes, we will use the [Pendulum AMM](https://github.com/pendulum-chain/pendulum-amm) in this guide but you can deploy any other WASM smart contract.



There also is a more general [tutorial](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/ink-workshop/pt1/) on how to deploy `ink!` smart contracts with Canvas UI provided in the Substrate docs.&#x20;
