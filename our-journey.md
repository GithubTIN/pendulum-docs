# Our Journey

The Pendulum journey began with SatoshiPay connecting the world through instant payments in 2014 and [has evolved to building a fiat-optimized Pendulum chain on Polkadot today](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/why-launch-pendulum-on-polkadot-7663d576591d). With Polkadotâ€™s advanced smart contract compatibility, an entire fiat DeFi ecosystem can be developed on the Pendulum chain including AMMs, lending protocols, forex optimized money markets and more. Imagination is the only limitation.

**Pendulum achievements so far include:**

1. Received Stellar R\&D grant to build Pendulum chain prototype&#x20;
2. [Raised $5 Million in a private sale round](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/pendulum-completes-5m-private-sale-to-connect-fiat-to-defi-56092a0506e9)
3. Started development of the [Spacewalk bridge](https://medium.com/pendulum-chain/introducing-spacewalk-the-trust-minimized-bridge-between-stellar-and-pendulum-68ddbe7349a0)&#x20;
4. Rocco testnet parachain deployment&#x20;
5. First milestone of the Substrate Builders Program completed

The next leg of the journey is to win a Kusama parachain slot for Amplitude and then a Polkadot parachain slot for Pendulum. Crowdloan participants will have the opportunity to earn AMPE (Kusama) and PEN (Polkadot) token rewards.
