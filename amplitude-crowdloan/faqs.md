**Amplitude Crowdloan FAQs What is Amplitude?** \
Amplitude is going to launch as a canary network of its sister blockchain, Pendulum. It will act as a testing ground for applications and network parameters for Pendulum. Unlike a traditional testnet, users can interact on the Amplitude chain with real financial consequences. We’re expecting lots of novel concepts to be trialled on Amplitude, giving rise to many exciting opportunities for anyone using the chain.

**What is a Crowdloan?** \
A crowdloan serves to trustlessly crowdsource KSM to bid on a parachain slot in Kusama’s parachain auctions. It is not exactly a loan, rather it is a way of locking your KSM tokens in order to vote for a parachain to successfully win a parachain slot in the network. For more information see our [quick overview](https://pendulum-chain.medium.com/parachain-auctions-and-crowdloans-on-polkadot-kusama-a-quick-overview-2e4892a0ec90).

**Will I get my KSM back?** \
Yes. Your KSM tokens will be automatically returned to you when the parachain lease ends after 48 weeks, when Amplitude wins the auction. Remember, we never have custody over your KSM. All KSM staked for Kusama crowdloans are secured by the Kusama Relay Chain.

**How will I know whether Amplitude secured a parachain slot?** \
The parachain auction runs for 7 days, after which we will announce the outcome. The best way to be notified is via our [social media channels](https://linktr.ee/pendulum\_chain). Winners will also be announced via 3rd parties, such as [parachains.info](http://parachains.info).&#x20;

**Where can I get a referral link?**\
****Sign up to the waitlist to get your referral link. And yes, it is possible to refer yourself for a extra 10% bonus!

**How to secure bonuses?** \
****Spread your referral link around and earn bonuses whenever somebody contributes via your link! Any contribution via referral link grants a 10%-13% split between referrer and referee. Sign up to the waitlist to get your unique referral link and remember you can refer yourself ;)

**How to boost my referral links bonus value?** \
****Complete all steps in our [Bonus Amplifier Campaign](https://sweepwidget.com/view/56242-be4yjdg0) and enter your Kusama address to have your referral link bonus value boosted by 3%. Make sure you are registered to our waitlist and have applied for a referral link following the confirmation email. The 3% bonus will be automatically applied to any contributions made via your referral link retrospectively.

**How to receive rewards?** \
Rewards will automatically be sent to your Amplitude address, which will be derived from the Kusama address you contributed with according to our release schedule. You may access them as soon as Talisman integrates Amplitude. If you want to access your AMPE earlier, you may import your private keys into a polkadot.js wallet.

**What happens if we win the parachain auction?** \
Crowdloan contributors receive AMPE to their Amplitude address automatically according to the release schedule. Winning the parachain auction allows us to plug into Kusama as a parachain for 48 weeks and everyone is welcome to start using and buidling dApps on Amplitude. After the 48 week lease period expires, the KSM are automatically returned to the Kusama addresses of contributors, in addition to any rewards and bonuses accumulated.

**What happens if we don’t win the parachain auction?** \
If Amplitude does not win the auction, the KSM tokens will be automatically returned to every contributor. You can relax! Regardless of the outcome, your KSM tokens will be returned to you by the Kusama Relay Chain.

**Can Amplitude access my KSM?** \
****Amplitude never has custody of your KSM tokens. Your KSM tokens stay bonded to the crowdloan module on the Kusama Relay Chain and you will be able to see them inside your wallet.

**What is the most user-friendly KSM wallet?** \
[Talisman ](https://talisman.xyz/)is one of the most user-friendly Kusama & parachain wallets. Managing your wallet and contributing to our crowdloan via Talisman is probably the easiest way to go about it.

**Does contributing to the crowdloan require KYC?** \
KYC is not required.

**What is the easiest and most user-friendly way of contributing?** Probably our website UI. We’ve designed our contributions page to be as intuitive and as easy to use as possible. Try it out!

**Can I contribute through 3rd Party crowdloan services like Parallel, Bifrost, Equilibrium etc?** \
