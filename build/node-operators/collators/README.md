# Collators

In this section, you can learn more about setting up and maintaining collators nodes on Pendulum and Amplitude. Collator operators secure the network by staking tokens and receiving rewards.&#x20;

From the [Polkadot docs](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-architecture#collators):

> [Collators](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/glossary#collator) are full nodes on both a parachain and the Relay Chain. They collect parachain transactions and produce state transition proofs for the validators on the Relay Chain.
