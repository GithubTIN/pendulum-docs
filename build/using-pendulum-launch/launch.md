# ðŸš€ Launch

The following command details how pendulum-launch is used.  The `--config` option can be used to set the path of a config file.  The `--log` option can be used to set an alternate logging directory.

{% hint style="info" %}
`pendulum-launch help`
{% endhint %}

```
pendulum-launch 0.2.0

USAGE:
    pendulum-launch [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -q, --quiet
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -c, --config <config>
    -l, --log <log>

SUBCOMMANDS:
