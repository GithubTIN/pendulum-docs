# Connecting to Pendulum

There are a number of ways to interact with [Spacewalk](https://github.com/pendulum-chain/spacewalk). In addition to our testchain, the spacewalk pallet is integrated into Pendulum. So first of all, you need to follow the steps in  [running-pendulum-locally](../../networks/pendulum/running-pendulum-locally/ "mention") in order to get your local chain running. Alternatively, you could use [pendulum-launch.](https://pendulum.gitbook.io/pendulum-docs/build/using-pendulum-launch)

Following that, you need to follow the steps described in [creating-test-accounts.md](../connecting-to-the-testchain/creating-test-accounts.md "mention") using the websocket port of the collator node as a replacement for `{spacewalk_chain_port}`. Once you have your accounts all set up, you can proceed to the next section.
