# Introduction

The Pendulum blockchain is based on the [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) framework and runs on three different networks:

* **Pendulum: Polkadot parachain.** \
  The "mainnet".&#x20;
* **Amplitude: Kusama parachain.** \
  The "canary" network. Tokens have real value, but network is more dynamic and experimental than Pendulum.&#x20;
* **Foucoco: Rococo parachain.** \
  The testnet. Tokens have no real value and network may arbitrarily reset.
