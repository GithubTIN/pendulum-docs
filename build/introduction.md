# Introduction

The Pendulum blockchain is based on the Substrate framework and offers, as of the time being three different networks:

* [Pendulum: Polkadot parachain. The "mainnet".](broken-reference)
* [Amplitude: Kusama parachain. The "canary" network.](broken-reference)
* [Foucoco: Rococo parachain. The testnet. ](build-environment/foucoco-testnet.md)

## Substrate

The substrate framework is a blockchain-focused tool to develop on the [Polkadot Relay Chain](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-architecture#relay-chain).
